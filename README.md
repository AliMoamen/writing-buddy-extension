# Writing Buddy Extension

## Overview

The **Writing Buddy Extension** is a powerful tool designed to assist admission processors in evaluating writing submissions. It provides real-time analysis and feedback on various aspects of the text, such as readability, vocabulary diversity, and the use of transition words. The extension streamlines the evaluation process, allowing processors to make more informed and efficient decisions. ✍️📊

## Key Features

- **Word and Sentence Analysis:**  
  Automatically analyzes writing submissions by counting words, sentences, paragraphs, and syllables to determine text complexity. 📖💬

- **Readability Score:**  
  Calculates the Flesch-Kincaid readability grade to assess the accessibility of the writing. 📏📝

- **Vocabulary Diversity:**  
  Measures the variety of vocabulary used in the writing and calculates a percentage of unique words. 🔠🌍

- **Transition Words Frequency:**  
  Identifies and calculates the percentage of sentences that include transition words, which contribute to text flow. 🔄📝

- **Interactive Interface:**  
  Features a clean and intuitive user interface, allowing users to interact with the text and view detailed analysis in real-time. 🖥️✨

- **Reset and Preview Options:**  
  Includes functionality to reset the text to its original state and preview the writing in a separate window for easier evaluation. 🔄👀

## How It Works

The **Writing Buddy Extension** operates by fetching the content from a writing submission and analyzing various aspects such as word count, sentence structure, syllable count, and transition word usage. This data is then used to generate a comprehensive analysis, which is displayed in an easy-to-read format with visual panels. The extension helps admission processors evaluate submissions more efficiently while still allowing for human judgment. ⚙️📝

## Caution

- **Not a Replacement for AP Role:** This extension is designed to assist admission processors in their role but does not replace human judgment in the evaluation process. ⚖️
- **Accuracy:** The analysis provided by the extension is based on algorithms and may not always be 100% accurate. Processors should cross-check the provided metrics where necessary. 🔍

## Limitations

- **Contextual Interpretation:** The extension may not fully interpret the context of certain words or sentences, especially when the intent behind the writing is ambiguous. 🧠💬
- **Over-reliance on Metrics:** While the extension provides valuable insights, it should not be the sole basis for evaluating a writing submission. Human judgment is crucial in making final decisions. 👨‍🏫💡
